## Setup, installation, and configuration
Your Raspberry Pi should be already installed and ready to go!  All you have to do is make sure it is powered on.  As long as you can see something on the display and it is responding to keyboard and mouse inputs, you are ready to roll.

## Starting Python
In order to program in Python, we have to run a program on the Raspberry Pi called a Python interpreter.  To start the Python interpreter, go to the "Menu" in the top left corner of the screen and select "Programming" and "Python 2".  The menu item is shown in the screenshot below:

Once you've clicked on the Python interpreter, it should start up and show you a window that looks like this:

**Note: Any time you need to restart Python because it crashes or closes just repeat these steps!**

## Interacting with the Python interpreter
The Python interpreter takes what you type and, after you press enter, it compiles your code (a fancy phrase that means translate it into computer language) and executes your code.  To give the interpreter your code, type it where you see the `>>>` prompt in the window.  For instance, when you first start it up you will see something like this:

If you want to enter code, just start typing in there!
